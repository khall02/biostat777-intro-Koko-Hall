# Investigating the prevalance of depressive symptoms comparing autistic and non-autistic children, using the National Health Inverview Survey


![](NHIS.png){width="60%"}


### Intro

**Research objective**: Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we will investigate whether autistic children have a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to non-autistic children. 

**Intended audience**: Mental health providers who care for pediatric and adolescent populations, including children with autism.  

**Data Source**: The original data came from the [2022 National Health Interview Survey](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHIS/2022/child22csv.zip), which is a cross-sectional household survey that monitors the health of children and adults in the United States population.

::: {.callout-important}
Autism is a highly heterogeneous condition and is not a monolith. In this study, the categories of autism and non-autism are used to examine whether autistic individuals have a higher prevalence of depression compared to non-autistic individuals, aiming to better understand targeted mental health interventions for certain populations. I acknowledge that autism is a spectrum, and each individual has diverse phenotypic characteristics, strengths, and needs.

### Data Wrangling

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
child22<-read_csv("NHISchild22.csv")
```
```{r}
# Filter for age greater than or equal to 5 years
agechild22<-child22 %>%
  filter(AGEP_C>=5)
```

```{r}
# Clean data: Remove NAs and unknowns for specific columns
agechild22 <- agechild22 %>%
  filter(
    SEX_C %in% c(1, 2),           # Male (1), Female (2)
    ASDEV_C %in% c(1, 2),         # ASD diagnosis: Yes (1), No (2)
    IDEV1_C %in% c(1, 2),         # Intellectual disability: Yes (1), No (2)
    DEPFREQ_C %in% c(1:5)         # Depression frequency: 1-4 (depressed), 5 (not depressed)
  )

# Recoding DEPFREQ_C to binary: 1 = depression, 0 = no depression
agechild22$DEPFREQ_C <- ifelse(agechild22$DEPFREQ_C %in% 1:4, 1, 0)

# Recoding ASDEV_C, SEX_C, and IDEV1_C to binary
agechild22 <- agechild22 %>%
  mutate(
    ASDEV_C = ifelse(ASDEV_C == 2, 0, ASDEV_C),    # ASD: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
    SEX_C = ifelse(SEX_C == 2, 0, SEX_C),          # Sex: 1 = Male, 0 = Female
    IDEV1_C = ifelse(IDEV1_C == 2, 0, IDEV1_C)     # ID: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
  )

```

```{r}
# Recode race variable HISPALLP_C
agechild22$HISPALLP_C <- ifelse(agechild22$HISPALLP_C %in% 5:7, 5, agechild22$HISPALLP_C)
agechild22$HISPALLP_C <- factor(agechild22$HISPALLP_C)
agechild22$HISPALLP_C <- relevel(agechild22$HISPALLP_C, ref = "2")  # Set reference level
```


```{r}
# Check tables for SEX_C and ASDEV_C
table(agechild22$SEX_C)
table(agechild22$ASDEV_C)
```

**Stratify by ASD**

```{r}
asd <- agechild22 %>% filter(ASDEV_C == 1)
typ <- agechild22 %>% filter(ASDEV_C == 0)
```

**Stratify by sex**
```{r}
table(asd$SEX_C)
table(typ$SEX_C)
```
### Analysis

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
library(survey)
```

**Weighted survey**
```{r}
wChild22 <- svydesign(ids = ~PPSU, weights = ~WTFA_C, data = agechild22)
```


::: {.callout-note}
Three models were conducted to observe the relationship between ASD diagnosis and depressive symptoms. Model 1 was a crude, univariate logistic regression model. Model 2 was a multivariate logistic regression model that adjusted for sex, age, self-reported race, diagnosis of intellectual disability, and socioeconomic status (presented as a family income-to-poverty ratio). Model 3 was a multivariate logistic regression model that adjusted for sex, age, self-reported race, diagnosis of intellectual disability, socioeconomic status (SES), and included an interaction for sex and ASD diagnosis.

### Summary 
In this study, participants had a mean age of 11.3 years, with equal representation of males and females overall, though males were overrepresented in the ASD group (75%), consistent with national trends. Regression analyses indicated that children with ASD had significantly higher odds of depressive symptoms in crude and adjusted models. However, after including an interaction between sex and ASD, this association weakened and became non-significant. Additionally, male sex and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms, while older age was linked to higher odds. The residuals from Model 3 displayed a bimodal distribution, suggesting that this model may not fully capture the structure of the data and may warrant further investigation.

### Functions
**dplyr**

  - filter(): Used for subsetting data based on various conditions (e.g., age, sex, autism diagnosis, intellectual disability, and depression frequency).
  - mutate(): Used to create new variables or modify existing ones, such as recoding variables (ASDEV_C, SEX_C, IDEV1_C, and DEPFREQ_C).
  - group_by(): Grouped data by specific variables (e.g., ASDEV_C, SEX_C, DEPFREQ_C) for further summary calculations.
  - summarise(): Calculated the count for each subgroup.
  - ungroup(): Removed groupings after calculations, ensuring the dataset is no longer grouped for subsequent operations.

**ggplot2**

- ggplot(): Initiated the plotting process.
- aes(): Mapped data variables to the axes, colors, and other aesthetics.
- geom_bar(): Created bar charts to visualize categorical data distributions.
- facet_wrap(): Used to create facet grids by ASDEV_C and SEX_C for comparison.
- scale_fill_manual(): Customized color fills for bars in the bar chart.
- scale_x_discrete(): Modified x-axis labels for discrete variables to improve readability.
- labs(): Added titles, subtitles, x/y-axis labels, and captions for context and clarity in plots.
- theme_minimal(): Applied minimal styling to plots for a clean, modern look.
- theme(): Further customized plot aesthetics, such as centering titles or removing legends.
- geom_point(): Plotted points in effect estimate visualization for each model term.
- geom_errorbar(): Added error bars to indicate confidence intervals for model terms.
- coord_flip(): Flipped coordinates, making the plot horizontal.
- geom_density(): Created a density plot for residuals to assess distribution.
