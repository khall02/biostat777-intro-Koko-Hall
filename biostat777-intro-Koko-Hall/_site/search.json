In this study, the categories of autism and non-autism are used to examine whether autistic individuals have a higher prevalence of depression compared to non-autistic individuals, aiming to better understand targeted mental health interventions for certain populations.

Regression analyses indicated that children with ASD had significantly higher odds of depressive symptoms in crude and adjusted models. However, after including an interaction between sex and ASD, this association weakened and became non-significant. Additionally, male sex and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms, while older age was linked to higher odds. The residuals from Model 3 displayed a bimodal distribution, suggesting that this model may not fully capture the structure of the data and may warrant further investigation.\n\n\nFunctions\ndplyr\n\nfilter(): Used for subsetting data based on various conditions (e.g., age, sex, autism diagnosis, intellectual disability, and depression frequency).\nmutate(): Used to create new variables or modify existing ones, such as recoding variables (ASDEV_C, SEX_C, IDEV1_C, and DEPFREQ_C).\ngroup_by(): Grouped data by specific variables (e.g., ASDEV_C, SEX_C, DEPFREQ_C) for further summary calculations.\nsummarise(): Calculated the count for each subgroup.\nungroup(): Removed groupings after calculations, ensuring the dataset is no longer grouped for subsequent operations.\n\nggplot2\n\nggplot(): Initiated the plotting process.\naes(): Mapped data variables to the axes, colors, and other aesthetics.\ngeom_bar(): Created bar charts to visualize categorical data distributions.\nfacet_wrap(): Used to create facet grids by ASDEV_C and SEX_C for comparison.\nscale_fill_manual(): Customized color fills for bars in the bar chart.\nscale_x_discrete(): Modified x-axis labels for discrete variables to improve readability.\nlabs(): Added titles, subtitles, x/y-axis labels, and captions for context and clarity in plots.\ntheme_minimal(): Applied minimal styling to plots for a clean, modern look.\ntheme(): Further customized plot aesthetics, such as centering titles or removing legends.\ngeom_point(): Plotted points in effect estimate visualization for each model term.\ngeom_errorbar(): Added error bars to indicate confidence intervals for model terms.\ncoord_flip(): Flipped coordinates, making the plot horizontal.\ngeom_density(): Created a density plot for residuals to assess distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBaio, J., L.
